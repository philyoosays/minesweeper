# minesweeper

### I once saw a web dev student try to make this game but couldn't figure out how to build out the "emply square" clear out. This means when you click on an empy box, all the adjacent empty boxes around it will also reveal themselves as empty boxes and this propagates out untill all empty boxes that are touching each other will also reveal themselves. So this was a simple and quick project that I took on as a small challenge.
